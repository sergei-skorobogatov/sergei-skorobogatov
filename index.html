       <h1>Hi, I am Sergei Skorobogatov!</h1>
       <p>I am a research engineer working in the areas of hardware security, attack and defence technologies.
       <p>I have background in electronics, chemistry, computer science (Ph.D. in 2005) and physics (M.Sc. in 1997).
       <P>My research interests include <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/Security/tamper/">Hardware Security</a>, Embedded memory security, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~swm11/research/g3card/">Smartcards</a>, Semiconductors <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sps32/dfm_proj.html">Failure Analysis</a> methods, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sps32/5c_proj.html">Forensic Analysis</a>.
       <P>I have a strong track record of establishing new directions in hardware security field and finding 'impossible' solutions to hardware security problems:
<BR>2002 - discovered optical fault injection attacks which shaked the industry with many semiconductor manufacturers still struggling with implementation of reliable countermeasures;
<BR>2005 - discovered data remanence in EEPROM and Flash memory which required tweaking of hardware designs in some Flash and EEPROM chips;
<BR>2006 - introduced combined attacks of fault injection with power analysis which opened up a new area for academic research on attacks and countermeasures;
<BR>2010 - introduced bumping attacks on Flash memory that can extract data from devices without readback function which forced many developers to implement robust countermeasures;
<BR>2012 - implemented hardware acceleration to power analysis for finding backdoors which forced implementation of more robust countermeasures;
<BR>2016 - demonstrated 'impossible' NAND mirroring attack on iPhone 5c which proved possibility of things officially named as impossible;
<BR>2017 - proved practicality of direct SEM imaging of EEPROM and Flash memory which paved the way for inexpensive memory extraction at scale;
<BR>2018 - demonstrated decapsulation on a battery powered chip which proved that decapsulation with acid is not as dangerous as it was thought to be;
<BR>2020 - found backdoor and successfully cloned Infineon Secure Element SLE95250 Optiga Trust B chip.
